Supervised Regression Technique
This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised regression techniques. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and the project was inspired by concepts learned from CampusX tutorials.

Key highlights of this project:

* Data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering
  
* Implementing supervised regression models for house price predictions
  
* Model evaluation and fine-tuning using performance metrics like RMSE and MAE
